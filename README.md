# Fractals

A collection of codes and modules useful for fractal image generators and fractal dimension calculators.

Please do not work directly on the master branch, if you want to work with this repository create your own branch and work on that branch!

Subdirectories:

- Generators: Stores the codes that generate the images and return the fractal dimension of the fractal.
- Modules: Stores the modules developed by me to be used in the generators, such as a module that automatically calculates the fractal dimensions (still nothing done here).

I'll try to fully comment the codes, as should you if you mess with it. In the beginning of every code, I'll leave a brief commented explanation of the code.
